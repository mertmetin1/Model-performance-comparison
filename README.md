### 2. Logistic Regression Model with L1 Regularization

#### Parameter Selection:
- Different values of **C** (`0.001`, `0.01`, `0.1`, `1`, `10`, `100`) were tested with L1 regularization to optimize model accuracy.
  
#### Results:
- **C=0.1** and **C=1** resulted in the highest accuracy (around **0.8306**).
- The accuracy of the L1 model stabilized as the **C** value increased.

#### Precision and F1 Score:
- **Precision:** 0.8294
- **F1 Score:** 0.8627

#### Recall:
- **Recall (Positive class):** 0.8281

These metrics show the model's ability to correctly predict the positive class and reduce false negatives.

### Conclusion and Evaluation:

The **L2 Logistic Regression Model** achieved the highest accuracy and AUC scores on the test data. This model demonstrates excellent performance in both accuracy and more important metrics like recall. The precision and F1 scores are also highly satisfactory.

Thus, the **L2 Logistic Regression** model has been selected as the best model for this dataset.

   Gender of the individual, where `1` represents male and `2` represents female.

### 3. **Boy (Height)**:  
   The height of the individual in centimeters.

### 4. **Kilo (Weight)**:  
   The weight of the individual in kilograms.

### 5. **BMI (Body Mass Index)**:  
   A calculation based on the individual's height and weight. It is used to categorize whether the person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

### 6. **Bel_cevresi (Waist Circumference)**:  
   The circumference of the individualâ€™s waist in centimeters, which is used to assess abdominal fat and the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

### 7. **Kalca_cevresi (Hip Circumference)**:  
   The circumference of the individual's hips in centimeters, another measurement used to evaluate body fat distribution.

### 8. **Sistolik_kan_basinci (Systolic Blood Pressure)**:  
   The top number in a blood pressure reading, measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). It represents the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats.

### 9. **Diyastolik_kan_basinci (Diastolic Blood Pressure)**:  
   The bottom number in a blood pressure reading, measured in mmHg. It represents the pressure in the arteries when the heart rests between beats.

### 10. **Diyabetes_mellitus (Diabetes Mellitus)**:  
   A binary indicator (`0` or `1`) that shows whether the individual has diabetes (`1` for yes, `0` for no).

### 35. **Target**:  
   The outcome variable. It indicates whether the individual has a particular health condition or not. It is a binary value (`0` or `1`), where `1` likely represents the presence of a condition (e.g., diabetes or hypertension) and `0` indicates the absence of the condition.

### Summary:
This dataset contains health-related information, including personal details (e.g., age, gender), physical measures (e.g., BMI, blood pressure), lab results (e.g., liver function, cholesterol), and medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension). The **target** variable is binary and could be used to predict the presence or absence of a specific health condition based on the other factors. This data is useful for building predictive models for health risks, assessing individual health, and making healthcare decisions.
